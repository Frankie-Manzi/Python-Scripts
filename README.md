# Python Scripts

## Objective

These Python scripts aimed to enchance my profociency in Python by creating scripts to automate simple and common cybersecurity tasks. These Python scripts include the parsing of my [HoneyPot](https://github.com/Frankie-Manzi/HoneyPot/blob/main/README.md) logs to detect potential brute force attacks and extract the source IP and usernames used in the login attempts, emulation of a very simple brute force attack and a strong password generator that incorporates all letters(uppercase & lowercase), digits, punctuation and is minimum 7 characters long. These Python projects demonstrate my abilitiy to apply simple Python scripts to real-world application of security tasks.
