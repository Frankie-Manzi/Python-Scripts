## Objective

The objective of this script was to strengthen my understanding of script writing to automate logs. The sample log used was a JSON log file that was generated from my HoneyPot Project. This helped me achieve practicality and realism, as this was a log file that contained real brute force attacks towards my HoneyPot, containing valuable information such as source IP and usernames used. The JSON log file contained over 250 failed login attempts and this script aimed to extract relevant information such as the source IP address, the top 5 most common usernames and password combinations and finally how many total failed login attempts were made.
