# Objective
This simple script was designed to emulate a very rudimentary brute force attack by iterating through a list of chosen passwords and comparing them to a predefined 'correct' password. This script was designed to enchance my understanding of the python fundamentals, specifically list variables, for loops and conditional statements. Additionally, it has also strengthened my core understanding of how brute force attacks work at a very basic level.
